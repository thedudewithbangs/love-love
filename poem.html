						<blockquote>
							With eyes like the stars, and a smile like the sun,<br />She captured my heart, and now I am done.<br />
							Her beauty so pure, like a rose in bloom,<br />
							With every glance, my heart is consumed.<br />
							From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one,<br />With her, my world has just begun.<br />
							I fall deeper in love with her every day,<br />
							With her by my side, I'll never stray.<br />
							She is the most beautiful woman on earth,<br />And my love for her will forever be worth.<br />
							With her, my life is complete,<br />
							She is my everything, my heart's true seat.<br />
							Forever and always, my love will be true,<br /For the most beautiful woman on earth, I'll always do.<br />

						<h3 class="poet">Ode to My Muse</h3>
						<blockquote>I am a poet, a lover of words,<br />
A man with a heart that beats like birds,<br />
A voice that whispers secrets untold,<br />
A spirit that's pure and brave and bold.<br />
I've searched for love in every rhyme,<br />
In every verse and every line,<br />
I've dreamed of you, my darling muse,<br />
A girl with grace and beauty to choose.<br />
You're the one who stole my heart,<br />
Who filled my soul with poetry's art,<br />
You're the reason I write these words,<br />
To show my love, to sing my verse.<br />
So listen close, and hear my voice,<br />
The words I speak, the choices I've made,<br />
I want to show you what I feel,<br />
To say that I love you and I'm real.<br />
You're the sun that lights my day,<br />
The moon that shines upon my way,<br />
You're the ocean's depth and grace,<br />
The fire that burns within my space.<br />
You're the rhythm of my life,<br />
The muse that makes my pen come alive,<br />
You're the reason I write,<br />
The one I'll love, each day and night.<br />
Take these words and hold them tight,<br />
And know that I will love you bright,<br />
With every word, with every line,<br />
With every beat of my heart that's mine.

						<h3 class="poet">Love's Equation</h3>
						<blockquote>Two hearts make a math equation,<br />
Solving for love, the ultimate solution.<br />
Add them together, as one they become,<br />
No remainder, no fraction, just sum.<br />
Happiness is the constant, love the gain,<br />
The answer is clear, no need to explain.<br />
The equation grows, with every passing day,<br />
No division, no subtraction, just addition all the way.<br />
Hold hands and never let go,<br />
Together you'll always be, this you both know.<br />
Love is the solution, the ultimate key,<br />
To a life filled with joy, and hearts forever free.<br />

						<h3 class="poet">Through the Storm</h3>
						<blockquote>When the storm clouds gather 'round,<br />
And problems in our relationship abound,<br />
It's hard to find a way to cope,<br />
To carry on, to find some hope.<br />
But then I feel your steady hand,<br />
Your shoulder there for me to land,<br />
And suddenly the world's not quite so gray,<br />
The storm may rage, but we'll find a way.<br />
With you beside me, I can face the gale,<br />
And weather any hardship that assail,<br />
For in your arms, I find my peace,<br />
And all my worries start to cease.<br />
Your love is like a beacon bright,<br />
Guiding me through the darkest night,<br />
And though the storm may still rage on,<br />
Together, we'll make it through till dawn.<br />
Let the winds howl and the lightning flash,<br />
We'll hold on tight, and we won't crash,<br />
For with you by my side, I know we'll thrive,<br />
And love will keep us strong, and alive.<br />
</blockquote>

					<div class="poem">
						<h3 class="poet">Colors of Love</h3>
						<blockquote>You're my rainbow,<br />
Red as the passion that ignites my soul,<br />
Orange as the energy that fuels my every goal,<br />
Yellow as the warmth that envelops my heart,<br />
Green as the life that weaves us a beautiful start,<br />
Blue as the calm that soothes my mind,<br />
Indigo as the mystery that we both find,<br />
Violet as the love that binds us together,<br />
Forever and always, now and forever.<br />

						<h3 class="poet">The Final Question</h3>
						<blockquote>Roses are red,<br/>
						Violets are blue.<br/>
						I have a question<br/>
						That I want to ask you.<br/>
						<br/>
						Would you let me try<br/>
						To walk beside your heart,</br>
						As we wander through</br>
						The gentle days ahead?</br>
						Could I court your smile</br>
						And listen to your thoughts,</br>
						Just to see your eyes</br>
						And share the quiet hours?</br>
